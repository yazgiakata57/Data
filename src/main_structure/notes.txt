how to handle more than one csv file at the same time?
-pull listOfLists and HashMap into a new class
-call sigma filter()
-DataSet filter(DataSet)

a downside: having two different reps of the dataset:
-define a get method in dataset that gives you the element from the given row and column
-make dataset and interface and have ColumnOrientedDataset AND RowOrientedDataset and this would allow to pick whatever rep is the most efficient way of implementation

datum is a specific data object: DONE
-rename datum to expression (done)
-datum would be a specific data type
-expression is code, code for transforming  particular data value or doing some sort of computation
