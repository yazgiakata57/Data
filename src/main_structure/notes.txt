how to handle more than one csv file at the same time?: STILL IN PROGRESS


-pull listOfLists and HashMap into a new class: DONE
-call sigma filter()
-DataSet filter(DataSet)

a downside: having two different reps of the dataset: DONE
-define a get method in dataset that gives you the element from the given row and column
-make dataset and interface and have ColumnOrientedDataset AND RowOrientedDataset and this would allow to pick whatever rep is the most efficient way of implementation

datum is a specific data object: DONE
-rename datum to expression (done)
-datum would be a specific data type
-expression is code, code for transforming  particular data value or doing some sort of computation


APRIL 18th 2024

-pass the dataset in the parameters, create a new copy to filter, filter returns new HashMap representing the new dataset
-continue with HashMaps to represent the dataset
-modulary


-IMPLEMENT GET
-DEFINE FILTER IN TERMS OF GET
-IMPLEMENT A FILTER CLASS class Filter { public this (Dataset, Column, Value) { uses get() to create a brand new dataset; (column=value)}
